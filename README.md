#965_CCS2025_revised_version_related_to_ethics

This repository contains the revised version of our manuscript, where the blue text represents the sections corresponding to the ethical concerns raised by Reviewer A and Reviewer C.

- **Response to Reviewer A's Ethical Concerns (Section 4.3):**  
  *We have revised the Ethical Considerations to align with Belmont ethical principles by detailing informed consent procedures, risk–benefit assessments, and equitable participant selection.*

- **Modifications Addressing Reviewer C's Ethical Concerns:**  
  - **Positionality Statement (Section 4.1):**  
    We added a Positionality Statement clarifying that our understanding of children with ID is based on caregivers’ perspectives rather than the direct experiences of the children, and we emphasized our interdisciplinary expertise supporting their well-being.
  
  - **Emphasis on the Care for Children:**  
    - In the Multi-Sensory Cueing and Replacement Behavior Intervention strategies, teachers adjust their methods according to each child's preferences (see blue text in Section 6.1).  
    - We also noted that strategies such as Functional Access Restrictions—which may ease caregiver inconvenience—can hinder the development of children’s digital skills (see blue text in Section 6.2).
  
  - **Alternative Outlets for Expression (Section 7.2):**  
    We propose that, beyond direct dialogue, schools and welfare organizations offer alternative outlets (such as drawing, singing, building blocks, and sandplay therapy) for children with ID to express their needs and feelings (see blue text in Section 7.2).
  
  - **Children's Informed Consent:**  
    In addition, addressing Reviewer C's concerns regarding children's informed consent, we provided further explanations at line XXX in the revised manuscript.
